Managing The Observing Environment.
###################################

.. abstract::

   The observing environment is a collection of repositories that are shared between different resources of the system. With it we also provide utilities to manage the environment (change/update branches on each of the repositories) and log actions taken by users.

This is complemented by the so called "run branch", which is a common branch used by the team for hot patches to the system.

This technote describes the details of the Observing Environment and how it is managed by our team.
